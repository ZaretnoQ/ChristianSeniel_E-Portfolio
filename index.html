    <h2>About Me</h2> <!-- Section header -->
    <p>Hi, I'm Christian Seniel, a passionate and driven individual with a background in programming. My fascination with computers began early, sparked by my parents introducing me to video games. This curiosity quickly grew into a deep interest in understanding how computers and software work.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in C++, Python, and the Qt framework, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge.</p>
    <p>I’m deeply passionate about both program development and game development. Creating programs that meet practical needs is not only enjoyable but also an intellectually stimulating process for me. I find great satisfaction in discovering multiple solutions to a problem and optimizing them for better performance.</p>
    <p>Game development, in particular, has a special place in my heart. Ever since I played my first video game, it became a source of inspiration and comfort during tough times. Now, having the ability to create those very experiences that brought me so much joy is a dream come true and a driving force in my life.</p>
    <p>When I’m not working or learning, I enjoy playing games and reading novels. These hobbies provide a balance that keeps me energized and creative, fueling my passion for continuous improvement and innovation.</p>
